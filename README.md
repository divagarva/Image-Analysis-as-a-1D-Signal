# Image-Analysis-as-a-1D-Signal
 This MATLAB project analyzes an image by converting it into a 1D signal. The image is reshaped into a 1D array after grayscale conversion, enabling signal analysis. Optional smoothing is applied using a moving average filter, and frequency components are analyzed via Fourier Transform (FFT).
